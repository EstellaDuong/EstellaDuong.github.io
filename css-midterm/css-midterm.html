        <h2>Vivaldi's The Four Seasons</h2>
        <h1>OCT 14-16</h1>
        <p>Symphonic bliss awaits you as your Colorado Symphony and guest conductor Aram Demirjian present a
            powerhouse program highlighted by Vivaldi’s programmatic masterpiece, The Four Seasons. As striking
            and admired as ever, this work conjures imagery that deftly captures the essence of spring, summer,
            autumn, and winter through music that manages to remain strikingly modern three centuries after its
            debut. Paul Huang is just the virtuoso to embrace this beloved concerto in its return to Boettcher Concert
            Hall. The grand finale — Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony — is a meticulously structured meditation on fate
            that endures as one of his most popular and identifiable compositions. Over four movements,
            Tchaikovsky transforms his personal battle with fate into one of humanity’s most powerful works of art.
            Among today’s best and brightest composers, Jessie Montgomery’s Strum draws on the spirit of dance,
            movement, and American folk expressions in an ecstatic celebration that will have you on the edge of
            your seat.</p>

        <h2>Beethoven Symphony No. 3 with Peter Oundjian</h2>
        <h1>NOV 4-6</h1>
        <p>History is replete with turning points and with the completion of his revolutionary Third Symphony, Beethoven forever changed the idea of what a symphony could be. A clear bridging of the Classical and Romantic eras, the Eroica (“Heroic”) Symphony explores what it means to be human in a work that is larger and more emotional than a symphony had ever been before. In it, Beethoven’s passion rises to the forefront, using broad strokes of sound to convey the very nature of humanity, while reimagining a future for music filled with endless possibility. Cellist Sterling Elliott — a 2021 Avery Fisher Career Grant recipient — brings youthful energy to Elgar’s Cello Concerto, a deeply emotional work filled with soaring themes and quiet anguish that will leave audiences entranced. The Colorado Symphony Chorus takes center stage on Vaughan Williams ’Walt Whitman-inspired Toward the Unknown Region, a remarkable marriage of music and text, with Williams ’inspired music perfectly encapsulating Whitman’s noble, humanistic aspirations. These works will spring to life in the hands of Maestro Peter Oundjian and your Colorado Symphony.</p>

        <h2>Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 with Olga Kern</h2>
        <h1>DEC 2-4</h1>
        <p>Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky — so highly regarded for his symphonic compositions — placed himself among
            the greats of the keyboard with the completion of his First Piano Concerto. The work is filled with
            towering grandeur, gorgeously lyrical melodies, and unmistakable Romantic spirit. For pianists what
            Everest is to climbers, the Concerto in B-flat has become the standard against which all virtuosos must
            measure themselves, featuring iconic opening flourishes and a pyrotechnics-filled finale. Denver favorite
            Olga Kern lends her dazzling technique and innate musicality to this cornerstone of the Classical Canon.
            Your Colorado Symphony and Conductor Christian Reif — dubbed a “remarkable talent” by the San
            Francisco Chronicle — conclude the program with Shostakovich’s stormy and brooding Tenth
            Symphony. Written to symbolize the power of the people, Shostakovich employs memorable themes and
            complex orchestrations that mirror his own battles against Soviet oppression. Ending on a triumphant
            note, this is a finale that will leave you breathless.</p>

        <h2>Ravel’s Daphnis et Chloé</h2>
        <h1>JAN 13-15</h1>
        <p>Be still my heart! A whirling celebration of pagan love awaits listeners with Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé,
            which he called a “symphonie chorégraphique” rather than a ballet, reflecting a sense of powerful,
            dramatic music which defies category and springs to life on terms all its own. Ravel’s exceptional score
            creates a sensuous atmosphere with a lingering explosiveness residing just underneath the surface. Scored
            for a massive orchestra and utilizing the ethereal, intangible tones of a wordless chorus, Ravel often
            spotlights solo players in a way that recalls chamber music rather than merely using it as a show of force,
            pulling listeners into a vast, visceral dreamscape of shimmering colors and hypnotic motion.
            Szymanowski’s First Violin Concerto will shine in the hands of Concertmaster Yumi Hwang-Williams,
            who brings expressive virtuosity to one of the first violin concertos of the modern era. The program opens
            with Lili Boulanger’s D
            ’un matin de printemps, meaning ‘On a spring morning, ’capturing the genius of
            this prodigious composer who wrote over 50 compositions before tragically passing at the age of just 24.
            This sweet and playful ode to spring is just the transportive overture to carry away your winter doldrums.</p>

        <h2>Beethoven Symphony No. 8</h2>
        <h1>FEB 10-12</h1>
        <p>Beethoven’s Eighth — which he referred to as “my little Symphony in F,”— is the most cheery, joyful,
            and experimental of his symphonies. Its relatively compact scale allowed Beethoven to be more
            imaginative and structurally radical than he could dare to be on the larger canvases of his other
            symphonies. Light-hearted and full of charm, the Eighth is an often-overlooked gem that will shine under
            the baton of Resident Conductor Christopher Dragon. Celebrate the Colorado Symphony Horns as they
            take center stage on Schumann’s Konzertstück for 4 Horns and Orchestra, incorporating the warmth,
            nobility, and hunting-horn origins of German Romantic-era music while conjuring images of the
            unspoiled forests of the German landscape. In an ironic twist, the performance begins with a “Farewell”,
            harkening back to the piece’s debut when Haydn instructed his musicians to stop playing one by one
            during the final movement, snuff out the candle on their music stand, and walk off the stage in turn,
            leaving just two violins to convey the final notes. In this uniquely imaginative performance, seeing
            is believing.</p>
