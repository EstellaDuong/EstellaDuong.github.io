      <h1>Extended Part:</h1>
      <p>I used an API of quotes in order to create this website. I also used an API which contained all the different "tags" or categories were used among all of the possible quotes. After reading the API and assigning to an array, I created another function and used a for loop to check through each of the tags. I checked if the tag had appeared in more than 50 quotes. If this evaluated to true, that means at least 51 quotes contained this tag. I then appeneded the tag, or category, to the dropdown menu. The user can then select which category they want their quote to be. When they click the generate button, the getQuote function is continuously called in a while loop until a quote that has tags that match the selected cateogry is chosen. In this case, the quote is displayed. If the category is "None", then any random quote with any category is displayed. The user can also choose to show who wrote the quote. </p>
